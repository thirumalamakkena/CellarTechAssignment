## Task Overview

You are tasked with building a web application using ReactJS and Next.js that allows users to explore destinations, read reviews, and create/manage itineraries. The requirements include implementing a destination explorer, a review system, an itinerary planner, displaying existing itineraries, and optional additional features.

## Requirements

- Implement a page to search for destinations by city.
- Display a list of destinations with their names, ratings, and the number of reviews.
- Use dummy data for destinations, including properties such as name, rating, and reviews.

### 2. Review System:

- Implement a review system for destinations.

### 3. Itinerary Planner:

- Create a page for users to plan itineraries.
